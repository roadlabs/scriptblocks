ScriptBlocks is a library that makes it easy create online blocks-based programming GUIs.  It is currently written in JavaScript/HMTL5, using the Google Closure conventions.

The projects's ongoing development springs from a collaboration between members of the [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu), [StarLogo TNG](http://mitstep.org/projects/starlogo-tng), [TaleBlazer](http://education.mit.edu/projects/taleblazer), and  [App Inventor for Android](http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/) teams. Our hope is that this project will allow people to exchange existing text-based scripting in their programs for blocks-based programming, thereby reducing syntax errors and reducing the barrier to entry for novice programmers.

This project's original code was graciously provided by the Playful Invention Company and Evelyn Eastmond in the form of a project called [DesignBlocksJS](http://designblocksjs.appspot.com/), a blocks-based programming environment for creating dynamic images and animations. Colin Greenhill from the [MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program](http://www.mitstep.org) used DesignBlocksJS, along with API ideas from Trevor Rundell's MIT Course 6 senior project, as inspiration and re-wrote everything in the Google Closure format.  The end result is a language-agnostic blocks programming library with an easy-to-use API, an idea first developed by Ricarose Roque in her MIT Course 6 M.Eng thesis and released as the [OpenBlocks](http://education.mit.edu/openblocks) Java library. The idea of blocks-based programming (as realized here) originated with Andrew Begel's work while he was a student at the MIT Media Lab. The idea has since been expanded upon and incorporated into many applications including the three that are driving the development of this project.
